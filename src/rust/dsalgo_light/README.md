# DsAlgo Light

Rust can do anything and is easy to abstract programs. This is a benefit of Rust, but it's easy for the files in a package to depend on each other in a complex way.
However, in competitive programming, it is easier to copy and paste if each element is organized in a single file as much as possible.
For that reason, dsalgo light is a simplified collection of some of the most frequently used features of dsalgo in competitive programming.
